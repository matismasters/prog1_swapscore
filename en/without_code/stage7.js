/*

In this stage we start to calculate the score points for each swap. Keep in mind the following concepts:
- Swap: The action of exchanging two numbers from a PositionA to a positionB in the list/s.
- NumberA: The first number to swap.
- PositionA: The index of the first number to swap.
- NumberB: The second number to swap.
- PositionB: The index of the second number to swap.
- Score: The points that a player gets after a swap.

### User Stories
